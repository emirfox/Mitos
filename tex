Yeah, that's me. I take up the last technology analyst, so I also work within CDS and I come under the AIML pillar. I think my location is quite technical in nature because there's another grad in my team, a technology developer, and we kind of have very similar things to do.  Um, In the initial stage of my rotation, I was just given like a POC to work on. So a project which didn't really have any deadlines, so kind of just getting me started on, on some work. That POC was dealing with an LLM model trying to convert some SQLs into snowflake.  And so recently after our PI planning, I've asked for more work to do with the BA Utah tasks. So they've given me more work for that. Um, which is again more like development work, creating a CR for some things.  Um, So work with like, um, the cheap, the cheap board and like, you get tickets aside, so I would say it's pretty similar to what a developer would be doing. Although, I think you can ask, like, uh, people either, so my people leaders add and you can ask him for, um, some other work that you might want to get involved in. I specifically asked for this.  So, um, yeah, I would say if you're, if you like technical work, then this would be a pretty good rotation for you. Um, yeah, and we work with like a lot of AWS, like um, AWS, so like a stage maker and like within the service catalogue and this rotation has also kind of helped me understand like how applications go into production, as well as like how like platforms are managed because that's what like my team does mostly. And although, um, everyone in my team has been quite busy, so it is hard to get support, although they they are very nice.  So when, when you do, Eat. It's just been hard to get hold of them. Yep But all of a sudden, like that's everyone
